This is from Taper #12: Tools, Spring 2024:

https://taper.badquar.to/12/tapered-airs.html

Part of a long-standing project to support the animation of poetic
text, this tapered tool will allow you to compose your own ‘air’
in the textarea that appears once its built-in composition has played.

To explore a more elaborate version of my developing web-stack tools
for ‘Scoring the Spelt Air’ please visit observablehq.com/@shadoof/stsa.
There you'll find a live code notebook with plenty of commentary. It will
soon be accompanied by an essay forthcoming later in 2024, and I'll make
an open access pdf available at programmatology.com when this is published.

You can interrupt my default composition by clicking the ‘stop’ button.
Once the default air has played or you have interrupted:
• Compose your own air, spacing out your words in the ‘open field.’
• If there is any magic to this little code, this in the t() time-to-read
  function:
  - The display-time of each word is increased according to the number of 
    its vowels and by attached common punction (not used in my default).
  - Time is also added for spaces before each word, about 75ms per space.
  - A blank line does not add time unless it contains spaces.
• You can change the ‘rate’ of the overall animation by entering a factor,
  e.g. 2 for twice the speed.
• ‘fades’ roughly determines the number of words that are displayed before
  they begin to fade out. If you set this to 0 there will not be any
  trailing fades.
• Please note that there is is a seven-second pause at the end of each 
  animation, after which, if still being displayed, the entire air will be
  faded out.

SELECT AND COPY any composition that you want to SAVE. It will not persist from
session to session or whenever you reload the page. Please do copy and edit the
source code. During the early stages of doing this, you will find the millisecond
pauses calculated by t() in the g[] array.

ANIMATE YOUR SPELT AIRS NOW ! And please enjoy. - John
