v="The number thirteen has been lucky for me. We experience passages of life which are caught in the grip of ill-fortune, ravaged by trauma and suffering, with bad luck falling haphazardly over all we know, feel, do or say. At these times, we are sensitized to superstition, often acknowledged in the form of minor apotropaic rituals: charms, spells, rhymes, sayings for warding off the ill-fortune that would otherwise intensify the trauma we’ve deserved. Like the single magpie, thirteen is a creature that appears irregularly during such passages of suffering. When we encounter it, we must make some gesture to avert a malevolent touch. I may not be superstitious but once I have learned (from my mother) that there is some haphazard thing that I can do to mitigate the harm this creature heralds, then, even if I will not concede its necessity, how shall I fail to do what I have learned? How can I refuse myself a simple gesture that many tell me may alleviate the suffering I deserve, a tiny effort potentially yielding powerful if short-lived relief and slightly better fortune? I was told to spit if I saw a single magpie and to crush eggshell halves because they are not stable vessels; to crush them decreases the precarity of those (my father) at sea. If there were ever free will, what is it, if it never brings me to a time when I will not spit or crush? Should I count my thoughts my words my letters and never let them get beyond a dozen? Wouldn’t my every next thought become a thirteenth pretending it was just an innocent first? I am reaching the fateful thought as I write. And because it is lucky for some, yours truly amongst them, then this fleeting period may be my only happy thought."
