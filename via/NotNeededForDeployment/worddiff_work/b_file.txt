This essay will not consider the problems concerning the future of teaching the art of writing in the face of the growing importance of nonliterate messages in our surroundings, although those problems will become ever more important both in the so-called developed countries and in societies where illiteracy is still widespread.

The future of writing, of that gesture which aligns symbols to produce texts, must be seen against the background of that tendency.
