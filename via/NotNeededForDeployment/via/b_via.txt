Along the journey of our life half way<br/>
I found myself again in a dark wood<br/>
wherein the straight road no longer lay<br/>
— Dale, 1996

At the midpoint in the journey of our life<br/>
I found myself astray in a dark wood<br/>
For the straight path had vanished.<br/>
— Creagh and Hollander, 1986
<sb/>

Half over the wayfaring of our life,<br/>
Since missed the right way, through a night-dark wood<br/>
Struggling, I found myself.<br/>
— Musgrave, 1893
<sb/>

Half way along the the road we have to go,<br/>
I found myself obscured in a great forest,<br/>
Bewildered, and I knew I had lost the way.<br/>
— Sisson, 1980
<sb/>

Halfway along the journey of our life<br/>
I woke in wonder in a sunless wood<br/>
For I had wandered from the narrow way<br/>
— Zappulla, 1998

Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita
mi ritrovai per una selva oscura
che la diritta vai era smarrita
— Dante
