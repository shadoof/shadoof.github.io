❡&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE FUTURE OF LANGUAGE
<pb/>
This “writing through” of Vilém Flusser’s ‘The Future of Writing,’ reconfiguring it so as to become John Cayley’s ‘The Future of Language,’ will not consider problems concerning any possible future for the teaching or philosophizing of any particular art of language in the face of the growing importance of non- or anti-linguistic messages in our surroundings, although those problems have already become significant in the so-called developed countries.
<ub>
Instead, it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems: namely, the tendency to deny or distrust the fundamental linearity of language – including as it is perceived during processes of reading – and toward multi-dimensional codes such as photographs, films, TV, screen-based graphic design in the service of social and socialized media, and, generally, a conception of art and aesthetics that is dominated by visuality, by so-called “fine” as “visual” or “plastic” art even as and when this world of art embraces the conceptualism or “post-medium condition” which could, in principle if not in practice, be extended to the arts of language.
This distrust and denial may be observed everywhere if one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds us.
</ub>
<ub>
Literature is $50bn behind art.
The MoMAs in every province and metropolis are stuffed to their gills with hipsters, gleeful families, and young “artists” while fewer and fewer deserted book malls provide desultory subterranean spaces for retiree reading groups.
</ub>
The “future” of language, or rather, of those gestures which align symbols to produce our shared, collective, readable utterances, must be seen against the background of a long-standing tendency to distrust their alignment.
<sb/>

<ub>
All those gestures that we make with the prospect that others of us might read and understand them as entering and helping to constitute the world of language, all these gestures, regardless of their perceptible support media are <i>archi-writing</i> in Jacques Derrida’s sense.
Iterable traces of actual language, all words are <i>writing</i>, as Derrida showed us.
There is always and only the “logic of the supplement” with respect to the perceptible traces of language, typically and phylogenetically supported by aurality; but in terms of cultural predominance – “historically” – supported by calligraphic and now typographic visuality.
</ub>
<pb/>
Instanced in integrated linguistic systems of inscription, the configuration of practices that we conventionally call writing is important because it both articulates and produces that state of mind which is called “historical consciousness.”
<ub>
History began with the authoritative emergence of writing in visuality, not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past, but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not necessarily perceived as a process, “historically,” unless one signifies it by successive symbols that persist as writing.
“Writing” in this historically implicated sense is ambiguous.
The effects of a certain persistence in collective memory – such as those promoted by oral cultures – are every bit as “historical” as the effects of literal or letteral writing.
This follows, clearly and simply, from post-Derridean thought.
Historical persistence in collective memory is an effect of what was archi-writing in aurality.
</ub>
<ub>
The difference between so-called prehistory and history is not that we have written documents that permit us to read the latter, but that during history there are literate persons who experience, understand, and evaluate the world as a “becoming.”
</ub>
<ub>
In what we prejudicially call “prehistory” this kind of existential, historical attitude has a different extension and scale with respect to the sum of human culture.
</ub>
If the art of writing (in either sense, post-Derridean or conventional) were to fall into oblivion, or if it were to become subservient to picture making (as in the “scriptwriting” of films), history in the conventional (historically emergent) sense of that term would be over, and perhaps it&nbsp;is.
<sb/>

If one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles, one can see that the purpose of this early conventional writing was to facilitate the reading of images.
Those tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals and “cuneiform” symbols scratched into them with a stylus.
<ub>
The “cuneiform” symbols form lines, and they obviously mean the image they accompany.
They “explain,” “recount,” “tell” it.
They provide it with an evocalization.
</ub>
They do so by unrolling the surface of the image into lines, by unwinding the tissue of the image into the threads of a text, the vocabulary of an utterance, by rendering “explicit” what was “implicit” within the image.
It may be shown through text analysis, through reading, that the purpose of such writing, namely, the transcoding of two-dimensional codes into a single dimension, is still there: every text, every utterance, even a very abstract one, also means, in the last analysis, an image.
<sb/>

The translation from surface into line implies a radical change of dimensionality with respect to the grasp of meaning.
The eye that deciphers an image scans the surface, and it thus establishes reversible and arbitrary spatial relations between the elements of the image.
It may go back and forth while deciphering the image.
This spatiality of relations that prevails within the image characterizes the world for those who use images for the understanding of the world, who “imagine” it.
For them, all the things in the world are related to each other in such a reversible, spatial equivalence, and the world is structured by “eternal return.”
It is just as true to say that night follows day as that day follows night, that sowing follows reaping as that reaping follows sowing, that life follows death as that death follows life.
The crowing of the cock calls the sun to rise just as much as the rising sun calls the cock to crow.
In such a world, circular time orders all things, “assigns them their just place,” and if a thing is displaced it will be readjusted by time itself.
Because to live is to displace things, life in such a world is a series of “unjust” acts that will be revenged in time.
This demands that we propitiate the order of the world, the “gods” of which it is full.
In sum: the “imagined” world may be a world of myth, of magic, an ahistorical world.
<sb/>

The eye that reads a text, the ear that reads to hear and understand a voice, follows its lines, and thus establishes an evocalized relation between the elements of which the language is composed.
Those who lend authority to inscribed texts in order to understand the world, those who “conceive” it, intend a world with a linear structure.
Everything in such a world follows from something, time flows irreversibly from the past toward the future, each instant lost is lost forever, and there is no repetition.
Each day is different from every other day, each sowing has its own characteristics, if there is life after death it must be a new sort of life, and the links of the causal chain cannot be exchanged one for the other.
In such a world, every human act is unique, and we are responsible for it.
The elements of such a world are, at least theoretically, distinct from each other like the beads on a string, and they can be counted.
On the other hand, the string that orders the beads, the “textual, evocalized flow of time,” is what holds such a world together.
In sum: the “conceived” world is the world of the religions, of salvation, of political commitment, of science, and of technology – the historical world.
<sb/>

It misdirects our thinking to ask why, six thousand years ago, a change of support medium for language may have caused some of us to substitute the world of conception for the world of imagination, although what we conventionally call writing did emerge in persistent authoritative gestures of inscription.
But many of us do ask this at present precisely because – heralded and augmented by digitalization – a “new civilization of images” seems to be dawning.
<ub>
Of course: for far longer than six thousand years ago, some people thought that some images needed explaining. Then new technics allowed them to discover practices of language that were amenable to persistent exposition.
</ub>
Images are mediations between ourselves and our <i>world</i>, a reality the unimaginably vast majority of which is inaccessible to human perception.
They are tools intended to overcome this fundamental human alienation: they are meant to permit action in a world in which we <i>cannot</i> live immediately but that we face.
Cave paintings are meant to permit hunting of ponies, cathedral windows to permit praying to God, road maps to permit motoring, and statistical projections – now reconfigured and em<i>powered</i> by AI – to permit decision making.
One must learn how to read and decipher those images, one must learn the conventions that give them their meaning, and one may commit mistakes.
For instance: it would be a mistake to read or decipher road maps as if they were cave paintings (magic for hunting tourists), or as if they were projections (proposals to build roads).
The “imagination” that produces road maps is not the same as the “imagination” that produces cave paintings and projections.
Explaining images with the help of persistent linguistic inscription may therefore be useful.
<sb/>

<ub>
But language is a human faculty not a tool for use.
</ub>
When encountering imagination, language, with more or less persistence, will always have articulated our general and historical consciousness.
There is in images, as in all mediations, a curious inherent dialectic.
<ub>
We see the world as images both literally and figuratively.
Visuality is, in a sense, opaque, and covers reality, substituting the imaginary for the real.
</ub>
Images come to constitute an imaginary world that no longer mediates between us and our world, but, on the contrary, constrains and deludes us.
Imagination does not overcome alienation; but becomes hallucination, or double alienation.
<ub>
Images do not reveal; we are what they show us.
We “adore” the images that we can see, even those images that we can see and the world does not.
</ub>
It is against this idolatry of images, as a therapy against this double alienation, that language works with us, through writing and other practices of evocalization.
Some of those who first spoke to us in our traditions – the prophets, for instance – learned this by committing themselves against idols and idol making.
And so did Plato when he announced his hatred of what we now call the “plastic arts.”
Language – historical consciousness, linear, rational thought – human inscription of what we become – this evolved faculty allows us to save ourselves from “ideologies,” from hallucinatory imagination.
<sb/>

Now, if we consider history to be the period during which conventional writing performs a rendering explicit of what is implicit in myths of the imaginary, this continues to be, for us, a problematic and painful, not to say tragic, process.
For the most part, historical consciousness is the privilege of a small elite, while the vast majority continues to lead an ahistoric, magico-mythical existence.
<ub>
The texts of authority have always been scarce and expensive.
The deep reading of books – literacy as the knowledge of how and what to read – is restricted to a privileged class of scribes and literati.
</ub>
The invention of printing did, historically, crack open our clerical classes and made the historical regime accessible to a rising bourgeoisie, but it was only during the industrial revolution and through the public primary school system that knowing the language of literacy and historical consciousness can be said to have become common in the industrialized countries.
But almost immediately a new kind of image, the photograph, was invented, which began to threaten the supremacy of conventional writing, and in the twentieth century it looked as if the days of historical, rational, conceptual thinking were numbered, and as if we were approaching a new type of magico-mythical age, a posthistorical image culture.
<sb/>

<ub>
Rational, conceptual thinking (and acting) has an intimate relationship with language as our shared faculty for symbolic practice, yet rationality, which is also in our world, may seem to us an exceptional form of existence, allied with the apparent progress of written history and perhaps no more than a brief interlude within our simultaneously ageless “eternal return” of the imaginary, of myth and magic.
But human practices of language, just like the imaginary, may be torn by an internal dialectic, and this dialectic may take a more pernicious aspect in language than it does even in image making.
</ub>
<ub>
Language may mean, and may explain images, and texts may become opaque, unreadable, unimaginable, and so constitute barriers between ourselves and the world.
Today, moreover, formal language literally constitutes images, concealed beneath their perceptible surfaces.
</ub>
The vectors of meaning of such texts turn around and point at their authors, instead of pointing at our shared world, real or imaginary.
This inversion of language may be observed very early in the course of history, but during the nineteenth century it becomes obvious: scientific texts (which are the most characteristic form of persistent writing, and therefore the “aim of history”) tend to become explicitly unimaginable (one reads them erroneously if one tries to imagine their meaning), and scientific research “discovers” the rules that order its own texts (mainly logic and mathematics) “behind” the phenomena it is explaining.
Such unimaginable explanations that mirror the structure of literate thought are existentially devoid of meaning, and in such a situation texts begin to constitute a kind of paranoid library wall that triply alienates us from our world.
It is against the threatening lunacy of formal rationalism, of a meaningless existence amid speculative, opaque explanations, that the rise of the new image culture must be seen.
<ub>
And yet the latest, digitalized image culture is, precisely, encoded and computed in the terms of this very “threatening lunacy.”
</ub>
<sb/>

However, it would be an error to suppose that life amid posters, traffic signs, TV programs, illustrated magazines, movie pictures, the internet, and feedback surveillance will be like life before we inscribed language as persistent visuality, that aliteracy will be restored.
Even those images generated by photo-optical apparatuses are unlike the images that have been given to us by the world in that they are themselves products of texts, and in that they feed on texts.
They are products of historical process.
<ub>
Scientistic technics allowed the construction of photo-optical image makers.
As for the images of digitalized cultural, they are composed from formal text as such, from programs and software.
</ub>
The essential difference between a TV program and a tapestry is not (as one might believe) that the one moves and talks while the other stands still and is mute, but that the TV program is the result of scientific theories (texts) and that it needs texts (for instance, telegrams) for it to function.
These types of images were called, by Vilém Flusser, “techno- (or technical) images,” and the convention they are based on Flusser designated as “techno-imagination,” so as to distinguish a world that was still in the future when he performed this act of naming.
No doubt techno-images are a sort of image, and they therefore mean, like every image, our world of myth and of magic, our imaginary.
But life in the future at which we have arrived bears a different relation to the mythical, magic, within which we had evolved to live long before textually defined apparatuses or digitalization.
<ub>
This difference may be addressed as follows: images as such are given by and are intended to mean the world; posthistoric images imply texts and are now also composed from integrated texts.
Imagination as such tries to grasp the world and posthistoric imagination tries to be text illustration or to illustrate the world as itself text.
</ub>
<ub>
Therefore, myths as such imagine “real” situations and posthistoric myths will mean textual prescriptions.
Magic as such is meant to propitiate the world, whereas posthistoric magic will be designed to manipulate people, to manipulate us, ourselves.
</ub>
<sb/>

<ub>
We can imagine a future for practices of writing but we must keep in mind the circumstance that language is an evolved faculty and will not change significantly until evolution enables it to do so – beyond the scope of our imagination – because imagination, myth and magic, our imaginary and symbolic existences are similarly evolved.
All of what we call history can only ever be something that we imagine and express as language within the scope of our evolved faculties.
We ourselves have not changed; our shared practices are reconfigured within this scope with respect to technics that are, indeed, associated with the symbolic, if not also the real.
</ub>
<pb/>
<ub>
The trend toward a culture of techno-images underwent a profound reconfiguration that was <i>pre</i>figured but not fully appreciated by Flusser.
As he anticipated, culture, <i>historically</i>, became a gigantic transcoder although not “from text into image.”
Rather, images are all now both transcoded and composed, inscribed as generative text in the sense of formal processes of computation, essentially and (to-date) necessarily <i>linear</i>.
</ub>
Culture is a sort of black box that has texts for input and images encoded and composed from text for output.
<ub>
In so far are these processes are now also multi-layered, so-called neural networks of probabilistic circuits, the culture box is truly black in that no telling of its text could conjure an image that we would care to see.
</ub>
All texts now flow into that box (news about events, theoretical comments about them, scientific papers, poetry, philosophical speculations), and they come out again as images (films, TV programs, photographic pictures, [typo]graphic design in the service of social and socialized media): which is to say that history flows into the box, and comes out of it under the form of myth and magic.
From the point of view of the texts that flow into the box – i.e. from the point of view of the contemporary regime of computation, from the point of view of Big Software and Big Data – this is the utopian situation that was misperceived in the late 1980s and 1990s: the box is the “fullness of time,” because it devours linear time, it consumes and renders time as persuasive images that consume our attention.
From the point of view of the images that come out of the box, this will be a situation in which history becomes a mere pretext for the programs that have produced the images themselves.
In sum, the future for practices of writing as such is to write and code pretexts for programs while believing that one is writing for utopia.
<sb/>

It is not important for the understanding of this present or any future for practices of writing to try to whiten the black box, to try to understand how it works.
The attempt to “demythify” the computational transcoding apparatus is, of course, one of the most important challenges of “forecasting and planning now and for the future.”
But it is not indispensable where practices of writing are the problem.
One may disregard the wheels and screws that constitute the apparatus (the countless “media,” “programmers,” and other human and quasi-human operators who compose it), and concentrate upon the images as they come out of the box left black, if one wants to see what it is to be a “writer” now and in the future.
In other words, it is not necessary to analyze the whole hopelessly complex system that stands behind a TV program or social media platform if one wants to understand any ostensible crisis of rational thinking and acting.
It is sufficient to analyze and critique the programs.
<sb/>

<ub>
As I say this, with Flusser, we presuppose a present crisis.
For Flusser it is a crisis of history, of teleology even.
For me, if it is a crisis that plays out at the pace and within the extension of evolution, with respect to which history and imagination, like language, are significant and affective faculties – entailing constrained, virtual potentialities – for a particular evolved entity. The end of this entity, the human, is certain, while evolution may extend for as long as evolved things exist in this universe. We are infinitesimal with respect to such extension.
There is no crisis of any moment.
</ub>
<pb/>
<ub>
Nonetheless, the circumstances of any and all relationships between language and imagination remain critical.
</ub>
History may be said to be the attempt to submit imagination to the criticism of reason.
Practices of language are meant to be critiques of images, and language, as a coded inscription, is an analysis of surfaces into lines.
Therefore, during history, imagination was the source of reason: the stronger the imagination, the greater the challenge of critical reason, and rich images permit more powerful linear explanations.
There is something iconoclastic about historical reason: the better the icons against which it advances, the stronger is reason.
But now practices of language are becoming subservient to image making, reason to imagination: one can observe this while analyzing any TV program or social media platform.
The better the reasoning, the richer becomes imagination.
Planning has become a highly rational process in the service of highly irrational aims.
The critical thing is therefore not one of oblivion for the arts of language, of reason’s decadence.
It is one of reason’s prostitution, of a “betrayal of the intellectuals,” especially the humanists.
One may sum this up as follows: when it became obvious that reason might be a kind of paranoia, the intellectuals stopped being iconoclastic and became idolatrous, and everything cultural at present, from TV programs to social media platforms – everything created by the abdication of cultural production to Big Software engineering and infrastructures – is the result of that conversion.
<sb/>

Social media platforms are not, of course, the most impressive examples of what happens when reason betrays itself and serves the imagination of Big Software infrastructure.
Fake News, proto-fascist Trumpism, and certain aspects of the surveillance-driven attention economy are better illustrations.
It may be held that proto-fascist Trumpism is one of the cruder advances in the direction of a future culture of images, or that the future techno-image culture will be proto-fascist Trumpism perfected.
This is why the battle cry “l’imagination au pouvoir!” that shook so many intellectuals out of their dogmatic slumber in May ’68 has such a dubious ring to it.
No doubt, rebellion against paranoid reason, against meaningless explanations, is necessary and healthy.
But intellectuals are makers of language.
They are committed to clear and distinct concepts, to reason.
They are the historical consciousness of their society.
If they adhere to the claim that imagination should take over, the dignity of man as a free actor, which means “history,” will be over.
<sb/>

It may be asked, however, what language artists can do in the immediate future but serve imagination.
If all the texts are devoured by the gigantic transcoder to become images, how can this trend be resisted?
Is it not so that if a text deliberately resists the trend, it becomes even better fodder for the universal computational transcoding apparatus?
Actions committed to history and against the apparatus, like monks burning themselves to death or students being killed in riots, are even better pretexts for TV programs and social media than are deliberate scripts made by TV programmers or video bloggers.
The universal trend in the developed world – in which practices of language and of digitalized writing in particular are becoming subservient to image making, planning to irrationality, and reason to magic – is now literally automatic: computed, <i>automated</i> and autonomous of both institutional and individual decisions.
<sb/>

This would be a perniciously wrong interpretation of any ostensible crisis of language.
Language makes and works together with images, and the task of reason, or symbolic thought as language, is to criticize imagination.
<ub>
This is doubly true in any supposed crisis.
</ub>
<ub>
Language must now make and work with both the techno-images of Flusser’s apparatuses and with the symbolic computational images of which digitalized culture is composed, and the task of reason, or language as symbolic thought, is to criticize techno- and computational-imagination.
</ub>
Of course, this implies a sort of qualitative jump onto a new level of meaning on the part of reason.
Practices of writing once explained images of the world.
<ub>
If we are to care for a culture that has been wounded and misdirected by computation, the arts of language will have to explain those illustrations that its programs have produced.
</ub>
<ub>
To write as inscriptional language practice meant, and may still mean, to render opaque images transparent for the world.
</ub>
Now, it must mean to render opaque techno- and computational images transparent for the texts they are hiding.
In other words, reason, in the past, meant analysis of myths, and in the future it will mean de-ideologization.
Reason will still be iconoclastic, but on a new level and with a new politics.
<sb/>

But language is an evolved faculty and cannot be more for us than it is, despite our deep reading of, for instance, cybernetics and software studies, or of structural and poststructural analyses.
It is perfectly possible that the general trend toward techno- and computational images is already irresistible, and that practices of language (as opposed to language-as-such) have already degenerated into the planning of programs – that to make language is already not to make “grams” but “programs” and that all texts are mere pretexts.
<ub>
There is no future of language.
An evolved faculty cannot have a future for an entity that has evolved to have this faculty.
</ub>
It is simply a fact that the making of language will either critique and exceed the techno- and computational imagination (which means unmasking the ideologies hiding behind a technical progress that has become autonomous of human decisions) or it will serve the production of pretexts for techno- and computational images, allowing a constitutive faculty to operate perversely as the instrument of reductive, scientistic “progress.”
In any event, as language speaks, the future is unimaginable by definition.
If language is to serve computation, history in any shared understanding of that term has already come to an end, and we may easily imagine what will follow: the eternal return of digitalized life in a configuration of big software architecture that progresses by its own inertia.
