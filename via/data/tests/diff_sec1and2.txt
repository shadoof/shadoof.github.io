 ❡&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE FUTURE OF 
-LANGUAGE
+WRITING
~
 <pb/>

 This 
-“writing through” of Vilém Flusser’s ‘The Future of Writing,’ reconfiguring it so as to become John Cayley’s ‘The Future of Language,’
+essay
  will not consider 
+the
  problems concerning
-any possible future for
  the 
-teaching or philosophizing
+future
  of 
-any particular
+teaching the
  art of 
-language
+writing
  in the face of the growing importance of 
-non- or anti-linguistic
+nonliterate
  messages in our surroundings, although those problems 
-have already
+will
  become 
-significant
+ever more important both
  in the so-called developed 
-countries.
+countries and in societies where illiteracy is still widespread.

 Instead, it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems: namely, the tendency 
-to deny or distrust the fundamental linearity of language – including
+away from linear codes such
  as 
-it is perceived during processes of reading –
+writing
  and toward 
-multi-dimensional
+two-dimensional
  codes such as photographs, films,
-TV, screen-based graphic design in the service of social
  and 
-socialized media, and, generally,
+TV,
  a 
-conception of art and aesthetics
+tendency
  that
-is dominated by visuality, by so-called “fine” as “visual” or “plastic” art even as and when this world of art embraces the conceptualism or “post-medium condition” which could, in principle if not in practice, be extended to the arts of language.
~
-This distrust and denial
  may be observed
-everywhere
  if one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds us.

 The

+future
  of 
-language, or rather,
+writing,
  of

  which

  symbols to produce

  must be seen against the background of

-All those gestures that we make with the prospect that others of us might read and understand them as entering and helping to constitute the world of language, all these gestures, regardless of their perceptible support media are <i>archi-writing</i> in Jacques Derrida’s sense.
~
-Iterable traces of actual language, all words are <i>writing</i>, as Derrida showed us.
~
-There is always and only the “logic of the supplement” with respect to the perceptible traces of language, typically and phylogenetically supported by aurality; but in terms of cultural predominance – “historically” – supported by calligraphic and now typographic visuality.

-Instanced in integrated linguistic systems of inscription, the configuration of practices that we conventionally call writing
+Writing
  is 
+an
  important 
+gesture,
  because it both articulates and produces that state of mind which is called “historical consciousness.”

 History began with the 
-authoritative emergence
+invention
  of 
-writing in visuality,
+writing,
  not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past, but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not
-necessarily
  perceived as a process, “historically,” unless one signifies it by successive 
-symbols that persist as writing.
~
-“Writing” in this historically implicated sense is ambiguous.
~
-The effects of a certain persistence in collective memory – such as those promoted
+symbols,
  by
-oral cultures – are every bit as “historical” as the effects of literal or letteral
  writing.
-This follows, clearly and simply, from post-Derridean thought.
~
-Historical persistence in collective memory is an effect of what was archi-writing in aurality.

 The difference between
-so-called
  prehistory and history is not that we have written documents that permit us to read the latter, but that during history there are literate 
-persons
+men
  who experience, understand, and evaluate the world as a 
-“becoming.”

  attitude

 If the art of writing
-(in either sense, post-Derridean or conventional)
  were to fall into oblivion, or if it were to become subservient to picture making (as in the “scriptwriting” 
-of
+in
  films), history in the 
-conventional (historically emergent)
+strict
  sense of that term would be 
-over, and perhaps it&nbsp;is.
