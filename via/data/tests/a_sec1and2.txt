❡&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE FUTURE OF LANGUAGE
<pb/>
This “writing through” of Vilém Flusser’s ‘The Future of Writing,’ reconfiguring it so as to become John Cayley’s ‘The Future of Language,’ will not consider problems concerning any possible future for the teaching or philosophizing of any particular art of language in the face of the growing importance of non- or anti-linguistic messages in our surroundings, although those problems have already become significant in the so-called developed countries.
<ub>
Instead, it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems: namely, the tendency to deny or distrust the fundamental linearity of language – including as it is perceived during processes of reading – and toward multi-dimensional codes such as photographs, films, TV, screen-based graphic design in the service of social and socialized media, and, generally, a conception of art and aesthetics that is dominated by visuality, by so-called “fine” as “visual” or “plastic” art even as and when this world of art embraces the conceptualism or “post-medium condition” which could, in principle if not in practice, be extended to the arts of language.
This distrust and denial may be observed everywhere if one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds us.

Literature is $50bn behind art.
The MoMAs in every province and metropolis are stuffed to their gills with hipsters, gleeful families, and young “artists” while fewer and fewer deserted book malls provide desultory subterranean spaces for retiree reading groups.
</ub>
The “future” of language, or rather, of those gestures which align symbols to produce our shared, collective, readable utterances, must be seen against the background of a long-standing tendency to distrust their alignment.

All those gestures that we make with the prospect that others of us might read and understand them as entering and helping to constitute the world of language, all these gestures, regardless of their perceptible support media are <i>archi-writing</i> in Jacques Derrida’s sense.
Iterable traces of actual language, all words are <i>writing</i>, as Derrida showed us.
There is always and only the “logic of the supplement” with respect to the perceptible traces of language, typically and phylogenetically supported by aurality; but in terms of cultural predominance – “historically” – supported by calligraphic and now typographic visuality.
</ub>
<pb/>
Instanced in integrated linguistic systems of inscription, the configuration of practices that we conventionally call writing is important because it both articulates and produces that state of mind which is called “historical consciousness.”
<ub>
History began with the authoritative emergence of writing in visuality, not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past, but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not necessarily perceived as a process, “historically,” unless one signifies it by successive symbols that persist as writing.
“Writing” in this historically implicated sense is ambiguous.
The effects of a certain persistence in collective memory – such as those promoted by oral cultures – are every bit as “historical” as the effects of literal or letteral writing.
This follows, clearly and simply, from post-Derridean thought.
Historical persistence in collective memory is an effect of what was archi-writing in aurality.
</ub>
<ub>
The difference between so-called prehistory and history is not that we have written documents that permit us to read the latter, but that during history there are literate persons who experience, understand, and evaluate the world as a “becoming.”
</ub>
<ub>
In what we prejudicially call “prehistory” this kind of existential, historical attitude has a different extension and scale with respect to the sum of human culture.
</ub>
If the art of writing (in either sense, post-Derridean or conventional) were to fall into oblivion, or if it were to become subservient to picture making (as in the “scriptwriting” of films), history in the conventional (historically emergent) sense of that term would be over, and perhaps it&nbsp;is.
