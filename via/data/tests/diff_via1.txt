 ❡&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE FUTURE OF 
-LANGUAGE
+WRITING
~
 <pb/>
~
 This 
-“writing through” of Vilém Flusser’s ‘The Future of Writing,’ reconfiguring it so as to become John Cayley’s ‘The Future of Language,’
+essay
  will not consider 
+the
  problems concerning
-any possible future for
  the 
-teaching or philosophizing
+future
  of 
-any particular
+teaching the
  art of 
-language
+writing
  in the face of the growing importance of 
-non- or anti-linguistic
+nonliterate
  messages in our surroundings, although those problems 
-have already
+will
  become 
-significant
+ever more important both
  in the so-called developed 
-countries.
+countries and in societies where illiteracy is still widespread.

 Instead, it proposes to consider a tendency that underlies those problems: namely, the tendency 
-to deny or distrust the fundamental linearity of language – including
+away from linear codes such
  as 
-it is perceived during processes of reading –
+writing
  and toward 
-multi-dimensional
+two-dimensional
  codes such as photographs, films,
-TV, screen-based graphic design in the service of social
  and 
-socialized media, and, generally,
+TV,
  a 
-conception of art and aesthetics
+tendency
  that
-is dominated by visuality, by so-called “fine” as “visual” or “plastic” art even as and when this world of art embraces the conceptualism or “post-medium condition” which could, in principle if not in practice, be extended to the arts of language.
~
-This distrust and denial
  may be observed
-everywhere
  if one glances even superficially at the codified world that surrounds us.

 The

  of

  must be seen against the background of

~
-All those gestures that we make with the prospect that others of us might read and understand them as entering and helping to constitute the world of language, all these gestures, regardless of their perceptible support media are <i>archi-writing</i> in Jacques Derrida’s sense.
~
-Iterable traces of actual language, all words are <i>writing</i>, as Derrida showed us.
~
-There is always and only the “logic of the supplement” with respect to the perceptible traces of language, typically and phylogenetically supported by aurality; but in terms of cultural predominance – “historically” – supported by calligraphic and now typographic visuality.

~

~
-Instanced in integrated linguistic systems of inscription, the configuration of practices that we conventionally call writing
+Writing
  is 
+an
  important 
+gesture,
  because it both articulates and produces that state of mind which is called “historical consciousness.”
~
 <ub>
~
 History began with the 
-authoritative emergence
+invention
  of 
-writing in visuality,
+writing,
  not for the banal reason often advanced that written texts permit us to reconstruct the past, but for the more pertinent reason that the world is not
-necessarily
  perceived as a process, “historically,” unless one signifies it by successive 
-symbols that persist as writing.
~
-“Writing” in this historically implicated sense is ambiguous.
~
-The effects of a certain persistence in collective memory – such as those promoted
+symbols,
  by
-oral cultures – are every bit as “historical” as the effects of literal or letteral
  writing.
-This follows, clearly and simply, from post-Derridean thought.
~
-Historical persistence in collective memory is an effect of what was archi-writing in aurality.
~
 </ub>
~
 <ub>
~
 The difference between
-so-called
  prehistory and history is not that we have written documents that permit us to read the latter, but that during history there are literate 
-persons
+men
  who experience, understand, and evaluate the world as a 
-“becoming.”

+whereas in prehistory no such existential
  attitude

+is possible.
~
 </ub>
~
 If the art of writing
-(in either sense, post-Derridean or conventional)
  were to fall into oblivion, or if it were to become subservient to picture making (as in the “scriptwriting” 
-of

  films), history in the

  sense of that term would be

 If one examines certain Mesopotamian tiles, one can see that the 
+original
  purpose of
-this early conventional
  writing was to facilitate the 
-reading
+deciphering
  of images.
~
 Those tiles contain images impressed upon them with cylindrical seals and “cuneiform” symbols scratched into them with a stylus.
~
 <ub>
~
 The “cuneiform” symbols form lines, and they obviously mean the image they accompany.
~
 They “explain,” “recount,” “tell” it.
~
-They provide it with an evocalization.
~
 </ub>
~
 They do so by unrolling the surface of the image into lines, by unwinding the tissue of the image into the threads of a text,
-the vocabulary of an utterance,
  by rendering “explicit” what was “implicit” within the image.
~
 It may be shown through text 
-analysis, through reading,
+analysis
  that the 
+original
  purpose of
-such
  writing, namely, the transcoding of two-dimensional codes into a single dimension, is still there: every text,
-every utterance,
  even a very abstract one,
-also
  means, in the last analysis, an image.
~
 <sb/>
~
 
~
 The translation from surface into line implies a radical change of
-dimensionality with respect to the grasp of
  meaning.
~
 The eye that deciphers an image scans the surface, and it thus establishes reversible
-and arbitrary spatial
  relations between the elements of the image.
~
 It may go back and forth while deciphering the image.
~
 This 
-spatiality
+reversibility
  of relations that prevails within the image characterizes the world for those who use images for the understanding of the world, who “imagine” it.
~
 For them, all the things in the world are related to each other in such a 
-reversible, spatial equivalence,
+reversible way,
  and 
-the
+their
  world is structured by “eternal return.”
~
 It is just as true to say that night follows day as that day follows night, that sowing follows reaping as that reaping follows sowing, that life follows death as that death follows life.
~
 The crowing of the cock calls the sun to rise just as much as the rising sun calls the cock to crow.
~
 In such a world, circular time orders all things, “assigns them their just place,” and if a thing is displaced it will be readjusted by time itself.
~
 Because to live is to displace things, life in such a world is a series of “unjust” acts that will be revenged in time.
~
 This demands that 
-we
+man
  propitiate the order of the world, the “gods” of which it is full.
~
 In sum: the “imagined” world 
-may be a
+is the
  world of myth, of magic, 
-an ahistorical
+the prehistorical
  world.
~
 <sb/>
~
 
~
 The eye that 
-reads
+deciphers
  a 
-text, the ear that reads to hear and understand a voice,
+text
  follows its lines, and thus establishes 
-an evocalized
+the univocal
  relation 
+of a chain
  between the elements of which the 
-language
+text
  is composed.
~
 Those who 
-lend authority to inscribed
+use
  texts
-in order
  to understand the world, those who “conceive” it, 
-intend
+mean
  a world with a linear structure.
~
 Everything in such a world follows from something, time flows irreversibly from the past toward the future, each instant lost is lost forever, and there is no repetition.
~
 Each day is different from every other day, each sowing has its own characteristics, if there is life after death it must be a new sort of life, and the links of the causal chain cannot be exchanged one for the other.
~
 In such a world, every human act is unique, and 
-we are
+man is
  responsible for it.
~
 The elements of such a world are, at least theoretically, distinct from each other like the beads on a string, and they can be counted.
~
 On the other hand, the string that orders the beads, the 
-“textual, evocalized
+“univocal
  flow of time,” is what holds such a world together.
~
 In sum: the “conceived” world is the world of the religions, of salvation, of political commitment, of science, and of technology – the historical world.

  human alienation: they are meant to permit action in a world in which

~
 Cave paintings are meant to permit hunting of ponies, cathedral windows to permit praying to God, road maps to permit motoring, and statistical projections
-– now reconfigured and em<i>powered</i> by AI –
  to permit decision making.
~
 One must learn how to
-read and
  decipher those images, one must learn the conventions that give them their meaning, and one may commit mistakes.
~
 For instance: it would be a mistake to
-read or
  decipher road maps as if they were cave paintings (magic for hunting tourists), or as if they were projections (proposals to build roads).
~
 The “imagination” that produces road maps is not the same as the “imagination” that produces cave paintings and projections.
~
 Explaining images with the help of 
-persistent linguistic inscription
+texts
  may therefore be useful.

 It is against this idolatry of images, as a therapy against this double alienation, that

  and painful, not to say tragic, process.

  writing, and

  it

~
 This inversion of 
-language
+writing
  may be observed very early in the course of history, but during the nineteenth century it becomes obvious: scientific texts (which are the most characteristic form of
-persistent
  writing, and therefore the “aim of history”) tend to become explicitly unimaginable (one reads them erroneously if one tries to imagine their meaning), and scientific research “discovers” the rules that order its own texts (mainly logic and mathematics) “behind” the phenomena it is explaining.
~
 Such unimaginable explanations that mirror the structure of literate thought are existentially devoid of meaning, and in such a situation texts begin to constitute a kind of paranoid library wall that triply alienates 
-us
+man
  from 
-our
+his
  world.
~

~
 It is against the threatening lunacy of formal rationalism, of a meaningless existence amid speculative, opaque explanations, that the rise of the new image culture must be seen.

 The essential difference between a TV program and a tapestry is not (as one might believe) that the one moves and talks while the other stands still and is mute, but that the TV program is the result of scientific theories (texts) and that it needs texts (for instance, telegrams) for it to function.

~
 No doubt techno-images are a sort of image, and they therefore mean, like every image,

  world of myth and of

 But life in the

  as follows:

  mean the

  posthistoric

-prescriptions.

~
 <ub>
~
-We can imagine a future for practices of writing but we must keep in mind the circumstance that language is an evolved faculty and will not change significantly until evolution enables it to do so – beyond the scope of our imagination – because imagination, myth and magic, our imaginary and symbolic existences are similarly evolved.
~
-All of what we call history can only ever be something that we imagine and express as language within the scope of our evolved faculties.

-We ourselves have not changed; our shared practices are reconfigured within this scope with respect to technics that are, indeed, associated with the symbolic, if not also the real.

 All texts

  flow into that box (news about events, theoretical comments about them, scientific papers, poetry, philosophical speculations), and they

  come out again as images (films, TV programs, photographic

  which is to say that history

  into the box, and

  out of it under the form of myth and magic.

 From the point of view of the texts that

  time 
-as persuasive images that consume our attention.
+and freezes it into images.
~
 From the point of view of the images that come out of the box, this will be a situation in which history becomes a

  pretext for

~
 In sum, the future

  of writing

  is to write

  pretexts for programs while believing that one is writing for utopia.

 It is not important for the understanding of

  of writing to try to whiten the black box, to try to understand how it works.

 The attempt to “demythify” the

  is, of course, one of the most important challenges of “forecasting and planning
-now and
  for the future.”

  the problem.

 One may disregard the wheels and screws that constitute the apparatus (the countless “media,” “programmers,” and other human and quasi-human operators who compose it), and concentrate upon the images as they come out of the box left black, if one wants to see what it

 In other words, it is not necessary to analyze the whole hopelessly complex system that stands behind a TV program

 Therefore, during history, imagination was the source of reason: the stronger the imagination, the greater the challenge of critical reason, and rich images permit more powerful linear explanations.

 There is something iconoclastic about historical reason: the better the icons against which it advances, the stronger is reason.

 One may sum this up as follows: when it became obvious that reason might be a kind of paranoia, the intellectuals stopped being iconoclastic and became idolatrous, and

 This is why the battle cry “l’imagination au pouvoir!” that shook so many intellectuals out of their dogmatic slumber in May ’68 has such a dubious ring to it.
~
 No doubt, rebellion against paranoid reason, against meaningless explanations, is necessary and healthy.

 But intellectuals are

~
 They are committed to clear and distinct concepts, to reason.

 They are the historical consciousness of their society.

 If they adhere to the claim that imagination should take over, the dignity of man as a free actor, which means “history,” will be over.

 It may be asked, however, what 
-language artists
+else writers
  can do in the immediate future but serve imagination.
~
 If all the texts are 
+going to be
  devoured by the gigantic transcoder to become images, how can this trend be resisted?
~
 Is it not so that if a text deliberately resists the trend, it becomes even better fodder for the
-universal computational
  transcoding apparatus?
~
 Actions committed to history and against the apparatus, like monks burning themselves to death or students being killed in riots, are even better pretexts for TV programs
-and social media
  than are deliberate scripts made by TV
