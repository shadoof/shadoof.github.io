In Language and Death Agamben takes as his starting point Heidegger's version of Hegel's sense that only the human not the animal has the faculty for language and for death the latter a condition that needs a name in order to be uttered in advance of its arrival When the death cry of the animal brings its voice into the field of immanent meaning an indicator without abstraction its achieved sign of annihilation leaves behind a corpse Language human speech operates analogously Concerning death or any other vocabulary of existence whenever the human voice leaves its bodily sound behind for manifestation as signifier sound passes into sense precisely at the expense of animal presence Such is the sacrifice within vocal speech of animality to disembodied abstraction The faculty mobilized by the human being over against the animal in any such semantic act let alone in signifying its own mortality is thus a kind of organic negation in itself the forfeit of somatic to semiotic determination
Meaning is thus born only from the evisceration of material sound as such Nor can language ever reattach to the embodied world by referential efforts Here in sum is the casting out by speech of noise by sema of soma by meaning of sound by verbal sense of mere voice Yet for Agamben a resurgent sense of voice in language is what poetry writes into recognition not voice as or at some lingual foundation but rather voice as a latency in reading tacitly communal Communal because species deep the very cause and effect at once of the human Put otherwise in a point never made in these terms by Agamben the philosophical sense certainty absent in the end stopped feints of language as demonstration returns in part from within its own silently shaped sounds in reading
In related terms recovering the resonances of human speech both from text and from the paradoxes of its silent sounding and building on the work of French philosopher Michel Serres in his investigations into the five senses Steven Connor has developed the notion of white voice in his study of Samuel Beckett's material imagination playing in the process off a more familiar concept like the slant rhymed white noise Under this rubric Connor ponders how one might turn up the garrulous dumb show of a stonily mute script in order to make good after all on the point in Georges Bataille from which understood as a statement about writing he initially demurs that the word silence is still a sound Connor finds Beckett's prose uniquely attuned as it were to the inner sonority of silent reading adding if inside is exactly where it is if sonorous is exactly what it is For Connor in coming to aptly punning grips with this inner hearsay the term subvocalization doesn't quite cover the case with its overtones to his ear of a vestigial enunciation He prefers the term virtual for this auditorium this arena of internal articulations that is not really inside anything or anywhere inside Its contours define what he calls the white architecture of vocality though without this topological figuration denying the time based nature of its potential effects including its cross fades by which I like to think he means to invoke the sort of lap dissolves I find in the counterplay of ambiguously fused lexical juncture
For Connor Beckett's phonic ghosts succeed as his chapter title puts it in writing the white voice whose register containing all possible frequencies amounts in a manner that further recalls the idea of potentiation in Agamben to a writing of vocality itself Literature does not silence sound Connor summarizes no doubt intending the double grammar banked in his own potential and corrective verb/noun inversion in the sounding of silence; literature he says instead auditises the field of the visual where it makes good on all the senses that swell together in the word volume Though Connor might also find the term secondary vocality too vestigial in its inference our approaches are nevertheless as idiom would have it on the same volatilized literary page where or whereabouts sound varying his subtitle is imaginatively materialized To mold Connor's emphasis more closely to Agamben's template in returning to the latter's demonstrations one might say that white voice is what keeps speech from going unheard in what its written form articulates
Following on from Saussure Jakobson and Benveniste Agamben looks to the phoneme and the deictic each strictly speaking disabled in the space of a linguistic act that suppresses the one and virtualizes the other leaving enunciation adrift between its loss of self indexical voice and its failure to index or indicate the world But poetry is always the beginning again of sound's gradual passage to sense where in entirely nonmetaphysical terms we find ourselves in language As if from a nowhere that need not seem withering poetry rehearses the very thought of language as it comes to one comes to be by taking place in one From the phonemes ghosting its speech through the referential phantoms shadowing its tropes poetry operates this way within the twin registers of music and deictic deferral meter and the self enclosedness of language together performing an always collaborative venture with the reader the rhythm of thought in words In a variant of Agamben's emphasis we may say that language does not probe and disclose being even its own; it realizes being by making it operative in communicative exchange And realizes the being of language in the processor in the related terms proposed by Geoffrey Hartman from the years of deconstructive ferment leading up to Language and Death taps in this way the working dark of aural experience a realm of the prior and primal phone to which all literary words are antiphonal calling to mind a voice or sound before a local shape or human source can be ascribed
