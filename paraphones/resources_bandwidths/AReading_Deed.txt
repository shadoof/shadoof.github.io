only the human not the animal has the faculty for language and for death the latter a condition that needs a name in order to be uttered in advance of its arrival
when the death cry of the animal brings its voice into the field of immanent meaning an indicator without abstraction its achieved sign of annihilation leaves behind a corpse
language human speech operates analogously
concerning death or any other vocabulary of existence whenever the human voice leaves its bodily sound behind for manifestation as signifier sound passes into sense precisely at the expense of animal presence
such is the sacrifice within vocal speech of animality to disembodied abstraction
the faculty mobilized by the human being over against the animal in any such semantic act let alone in signifying its own mortality is thus a kind of organic negation in itself the forfeit of somatic to semiotic determination
meaning is thus born only from the evisceration of material sound as such
nor can language ever reattach to the embodied world by referential efforts
here in sum is the casting out by speech of noise by meaning of sound by verbal sense of mere voice
a resurgent sense of voice in language is what poetry writes into recognition not voice as or at some lingual foundation but rather voice as a latency in reading tacitly communal
communal because species deep the very cause and effect at once of the human
the philosophical sense certainty absent in the end stopped feints of language as demonstration returns in part from within its own silently shaped sounds in reading
recovering the resonances of human speech both from text and from the paradoxes of its silent sounding white voice plays off a more familiar concept like the slant rhymed white noise
turn up the garrulous dumb show of a stonily mute script in order to make good after all on the point that the word silence is still a sound uniquely attuned as it were to the inner sonority of silent reading
if inside is exactly where it is if sonorous is exactly what it is
in coming to aptly punning grips with this inner hearsay the term sub vocalization doesn’t quite cover the case with its overtones of a vestigial enunciation
prefer the term virtual for this arena of internal articulations that is not really inside anything or anywhere inside
its contours define the white architecture of vocality though without this figuration denying the time based nature of its potential effects including its cross fades
to invoke the sort of lap dissolves in the counterplay of ambiguously fused lexical juncture
phonic ghosts succeed in writing the white voice whose register containing all possible frequencies amounts in a manner that further recalls the idea of potentiation to a writing of vocality itself
literature does not silence sound no doubt intending the double grammar banked in the sounding of silence
literature makes good on all the senses that swell together in the word volume
sound is materialized in the imagination
white voice is what keeps speech from going unheard in what its written form articulates
the phoneme and the deictic and each strictly speaking disabled in the space of a linguistic act that suppresses the one and virtualizes the other leaving enunciation adrift between its loss of self indexical voice and its failure to index or indicate the world
but poetry is always the beginning again of sound’s gradual passage to sense where in entirely non metaphysical terms we find ourselves in language
as if from a nowhere that need not seem withering poetry rehearses the very thought of language as it comes to one comes to be by taking place in one
from the phonemes ghosting its speech through the referential phantoms shadowing its tropes poetry operates this way within the twin registers of music and deictic deferral meter and the self enclosedness of language together performing an always collaborative venture with the reader the rhythm of thought in words
language does not probe and disclose being even its own
it realizes being by making it operative in communicative exchange
and realizes the being of language in the process
or taps in this way the working dark of aural experience a realm of the prior and primal phone to which all literary words are antiphonal calling to mind a voice or sound before a local shape or human source can be ascribed
