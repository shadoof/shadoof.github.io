      <span class="text invisible">“Digital” at this moment is a (con)temporary qualifier – for “language art” and many other practices – referring to the prevalence of digital affordances and infrastructures which allow us to discover new ways of reading language and language art.</span> 
	  <span class="text">In practice, because language is an evolved faculty, and, to the extent of our knowledge, is species specific (</span><a href="lmrbib.html#berwick"><span class="text">Berwick and Chomsky 2016; Hurford 2014, 2012</span></a><span class="text">), (linguistic) aurality is the support medium for language that has been privileged by evolution. Hand-written or typographic visuality is the support medium which the advent of human history and the course of civilization has promoted to a literal <em>authority</em> that is, <em>ironically</em>, logocentric and metaphysically implicated, as Derrida has shown (</span><a href="lmrbib.html#derrida97"><span class="text">Derrida 1997</span></a><span class="text">).</span>
	  <span id="invisible">In the near future, the digitalization of aurality will reconfigure, historically, these privileged relationships between support media and language (Cayley 2018a).</span>
