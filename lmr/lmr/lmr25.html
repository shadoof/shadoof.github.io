      <span class="text"><em>The processes of grammalepsis generate grammè as shared symbolic events of language, bringing language into being.</em> It is important to say that the creation of the grammè by reading implies that, so long as these grammè are shared by a community of language practice, they will be not only distinct – (re)iterable, symbolic – forms, they may also be newly created forms and thus both constitutive of language, and also an indication, as generated and generative, of what some philosophers of language, including Charles Taylor, would call <em>constitutive language</em> (Taylor 2016, 3-50).</span>
      <span class="text alwaysOn">This term is in contradistinction to <em>designative language</em>. The latter term refers to a strictly structuralist and positivist philosophy or science of language within the scope of which “creativity” is a function of (re)combination and syntactical reordering.
