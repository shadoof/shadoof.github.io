      <span class="text invisible">But what is language? What is language ontologically? Based on experience and the science available to us, language is something <em>interpersonal</em> that we have evolved to have. By “interpersonal” I mean that  language both depends on and constitutes <em>the social</em>.</span>

      <span id="invisible">Language is only ever brought into being by means of the active responses of others, responses made to and with human persons or (recently, as of the 2010s) humanoid entities. These persons or humanoids make formal gestures of virtual language that become actual language when they are grasped as such by their interlocutors.
