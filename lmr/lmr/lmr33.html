      <span id="invisible">All traces of language indicate an <em>archi-writing</em> in Jacques Derrida’s sense. This relation is fundamentally synaesthetic, since our experience encompasses all that we perceive, and in language we trace our experience.</span> 
      <span class="text invisible">The processes of grammalepsis are support media agnostic. Any perceptible and malleable medium will do, in principle.</span> 
      <span class="text">After all, these processes – (grammaleptic) <em>reading</em> by another name – render gestures that are expressed in any perceptible and malleable medium as ontologically and diegetically distinct, broken out and away from their support medium, and thus suddenly and simultaneously in the world of language.</span> 
      <span id="invisible">This is not to say, however, that any artificially or aesthetically structured substance or artifact or performance in structured artifactuality can or should be treated <em>as</em> or <em>like</em> (a) language, because not all such structures are readable.
