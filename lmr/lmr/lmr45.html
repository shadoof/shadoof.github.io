      <span class="text invisible">Voice is, a fortiori, the medium for any self-reflexive practice of aesthetic language, of experimental writing, poetry, language art, digital language art. Making this statement implies that – by giving physical evidence of embodiment – language cares to support and produce located, integral, personal identities.</span> 
      <span class="text">But this voice is not only voice as of actual, particular human voices.</span> 
      <span id="invisible">The characteristics of sited integrity and identity are required by linguistic objects in the symbolic abstract, as well as being contingent upon the fact that voice and human voices possess these characteristics. Thus, by the way, there is no recourse to idealism in this thinking but, rather, a counter affirmation of the deep pragmatic necessity for virtual linguistic forms and traces – at any and all levels of structure – to achieve states of sited integrity and identity in order to become language as such.
