      <span class="text">It is worth remembering, also, that the proto-linguistic gestural forms of our world and of human life are <em>data</em>, what the world gives; not <em>capta</em>, what we have been able to capture or transcribe from this data. We read what our world gives into language and then some of this language is transcribed from our grapholects into capta. Reading the written capta – which we call text – back into actual language requires the recovery of experiences closer to those by means of which we read (past, present, and future) the actual data of our world into language.
