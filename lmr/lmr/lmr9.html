      <span class="text">There are many people in the world who are designated, markedly, as “illiterate.” This adjective suggests a lack or a failing, but only in relation to a presumed, historically literate culture, for which “literacy” is, to say the least, a significant cultural value. Any concomitantly presumed “lack,” however, has no bearing on our human species’ shared faculty of language. We would not consider someone who does not know Italian to be somehow lacking in their faculty of language or, a fortiori, lacking in some essential aspect of their humanity. And we should not do so with respect to anyone who happens not to know those grapholects or visually inscribed languages that we may know.
