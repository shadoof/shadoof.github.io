      <span class="text">Voice is, a fortiori, the medium for any self-reflexive practice of aesthetic language, of experimental writing, poetry, language art, digital language art. Making this statement implies that – by giving physical evidence of embodiment – language cares to support and produce located, integral, personal identities.</span> 
      <span id="invisible">But this voice is not only voice as of actual, particular human voices.</span> 
      <span id="invisible">The characteristics of sited integrity and identity are required by linguistic objects in the symbolic abstract, as well as being contingent upon the fact that voice and human voices possess these characteristics. And acknowledging that there is a pragmatic necessity for virtual linguistic forms and traces – at any and all levels of linguistic structure – to achieve states of sited integrity and identity runs counter to Platonic idealism.
