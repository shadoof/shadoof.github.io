      <span class="text"><i>Machines are said to ‘read’ text in a variety of ways which now include its being taken in and analyzed by so-called </i>AI<i>, by Machine or Deep Learning algorithms which generate what are usually referred to as ‘language models.’ These models become capable, it is proposed, of ‘automatically’ generating </i>language<i> if not, yet, ‘understanding’ it. But is it actually </i>language<i>, in any significant or affective sense, of which these analyses are models? They are certainly models of once articulated </i>text<i>, text that may well be some kind of record or representation of linguistic behavior, but to understand the relationship between these engines of contemporary computation and human language, we must enquire a little more deeply into the question of what language </i>is<i>.</i></span>

In its present form, it takes you through my thinking at a steady pace, but only directly addresses so-called </i>AI<i> as it approaches its conclusion. In this rendition, I've provided an </i>i[n]d[e]x<i> for less linear navigation of its 72 textual spaces, but I hope that most readers will – at least for their first reading – follow the essay’s online flow.</span>
