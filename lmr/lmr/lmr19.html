      <span class="text">“Grammaleptic” is an adjective derived from my own coinage, <em>grammalepsy</em>. “Grammalepsy” is a noun indicating a condition or circumstance. “Grammalepsis,” also a noun, refers to the associated processes, particularly processes of reading. The “lepsis” in “grammalepsis” is the seizure, by articulable human thought, of “grammè,” of (re)iterable, shared symbolic forms.
      </span> 
      <span id="invisible">The seizure of grammè in terms of <em>lepsis</em> is intended to suggest that these events are sudden, and that they cause breaks corresponding to both the discrete idealities of the symbolic forms which are so generated, and to a “breaking away,” ontologically, from the support media in which these forms are expressed. Grammalepsy is the human condition that allows gestures in any perceptible and malleable support medium to become (re)iterable, shared symbolic forms and simultaneously elements of language itself (at any level of linguistic structure), thus bringing language into being.
