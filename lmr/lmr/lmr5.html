      <span class="text invisible">The language that machines “read” – at any particular moment – has been excerpted or extracted from what Walter Ong calls a <em>grapholect</em>, “a transdialect language formed by deep commitment to writing” (Ong 1982, 8). A little more precisely, machines read encoded transcriptions of grapholects that are tightly integrated with natural languages.
