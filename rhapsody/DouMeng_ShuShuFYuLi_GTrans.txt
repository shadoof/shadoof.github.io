Word Cases in "Shu Shu Fu"

Dou Meng


My younger brother, Shang Nianjun, is named Lingchang, Zhang and Wang in calligraphy and ink, and Lingban and Ma in Wenwen. The rhetoric is powerful, and the grass is profound. There are more than 100,000 words of inscriptions, poems, odes, and chapters in his life. Compared with the magnificent ones, there are "Fu of Datong" and "Fu of Sandian Cu_" presented by Tianbao. It is based on irony, prosperity and freezing and purification; it is based on Kuang Jun's saving time. The emperor is Zier, who can compile books, envoys to kings, honor Qili, dragon chapters and phoenix seal scripts, and favor Xi Confucianism. In his later years, he also wrote "Shu Shu Fu", with a total of 7,460 words, which is concise and essential, and the secret meaning is carefully identified. Collecting "Five Classics" and "Three Tombs", examining "Jiuqiu", "Basuo", "Poetry", "Sao", "Li", "Yi", and the collection of anthologies are still unknown. So don't make a conclusion and make a statement, and the Qu Shen is profound. One word and one sentence, the meaning of the number bypasses. Mr. Shangnian learned about heaven and man, and he was able to understand the ancient scriptures. His annotations and analysis were all based on historical biography. The notes are not exhausted, in this example; the meaning is not exhausted, in this case. For all the ancient and modern wise men, the main text calls out the words; the distinguished elders, each speaks about his relatives. Or take advantage of the official, or because of the words of the title. A sentence is two words, three words, five words, four words, and, between, between, or six, or eight. When changing times and revolutions, follow one another. Concerned about scholars raising doubts, Shi Zhu points out. The rationale and examples of this language have unique characters. There are one hundred and twenty words, and two hundred and forty sentences are noted. Both praise and derogation are also the same posthumous posthumous method. The text is full of emotion, but the caress has collapsed. The handwriting is just like the pen that has always been written; the genius Zhuoer has been divided for thousands of years. Kaoyi remembers the heart, and smiles in the eyes. One branch is broken first, and the pain penetrates the liver and intestines. Both eyes are dry, mourning entangles the bone marrow.
